## Challenge

The function `createMedalTable` in [medals.test.js](medals.test.js) is left without an implementation. In the same file, there's a test that takes a defined input and output for testing your implementation.

Update the repository to be able to run the test in the file, it's executed using the `jest` runner with `yarn` or `npm` as per your preference, you may have to update the config files.

Commit your changes and push them up to your own git repositry!
Once done, link us the URL of your solution

## Tips

The data set in the test ends at parent 4, but imagine any number of parents and children could be passed to this function.

When the test passes clean up your code.
It's worth spending time formatting and simplifing things.
It's more important that humans can read your code than computers.
Software tools like `eslint` do some amazing things ðŸ•¶
